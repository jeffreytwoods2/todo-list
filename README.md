# todo-list

## [Live App](https://mighty-reef-31912.herokuapp.com)

### Overview

This is a todo list to practice MongoDB CRUD operations. I also practiced filtering db entries with a "completed" Boolean toggle.
You can decide whether to see completed tasks, pending tasks, or all tasks.

### Instructions

Open the app in your web browser and add some todos! I haven't practiced authorization yet, so this db will just have every todo anyone in the world decides to add. Anyone can create, read, update, and delete.

### Tech Stack

<ul>
    <li>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</li>

</ul>

### Future Development

Add user authentication and authorization, only show todos that belong to a specific user who has authenticated.
